##Pebble.rs Template

This is a template application demonstrating the use of
(Pebble.rs)[https://github.com/andars/pebble.rs]. It includes the modified
`wscript` and a build script that performs the necessary tasks to link in the
`pebble` crate. This is very hacky but it works and I haven't been able to
figure out any better solutions that actually work.

In order to build, clone (pebble.rs)[https://github.com/andars/pebble.rs] to
somewhere on your computer and modify the `path` in Cargo.toml as appropriate.



*This is very much a work in progress*
